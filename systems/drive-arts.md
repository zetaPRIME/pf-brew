Manachargers do not use ammunition, but can only be fired by someone with some sort of magical aptitude (able to cast spells or use Drive Arts or other spell-like abilities).

Upon misfiring, a Manacharger does not gain the *broken* condition, but instead backfires, dealing 1d4 force damage to the wielder. This does not increase the weapon's misfire rate.
