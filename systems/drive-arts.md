# Drive Arts
Certain classes grant access to potent abilities drawing from an innate pool of latent magic, represented as Drive Points.
This reservoir has a limited capacity (as granted by classes and feats), but any points gained beyond this limit during combat last until the end of the user's current or upcoming turn.

- If multiple sources grant the same ability modifier to maximum Drive Points, only one applies.
- At the start of each day, a Drive Art user regains up to their maximum Drive Points.

Drive Arts can only be used while wielding a weapon with the *drive weapon* property, as they are channeled through the weapon itself. Accordingly, arts of range type *weapon* have range of a single target within that weapon's melee range if it's a melee weapon, or line of sight within the first range increment if it's a ranged weapon. If the weapon is usable as both melee and ranged, then the wielder may choose between them as desired.

#### Overdrive
If a Drive Art specifies more than one Drive Point cost (separated by a slash), you can pay the second (or later) cost upon activation to *overdrive* it *(assuming you meet any requirements specified)*, gaining a bonus specified within the body of the art's entry. Your *overdrive level* is 0 if paying the normal cost, 1 if paying the second, etc.

#### Terms
*DP cost* - The Drive Point cost paid to activate the art. Multiple values separated by a slash indicates that the art can be *overdriven*.   
*Modifies* - Indicates that the art modifies a particular action taken. Only a single art may be used to modify a given action where not otherwise indicated.  
*Driver level* - user's combined level in all classes that grant Drive Arts (minimum 1).  

## Drive Arts - Common
*(Any Drive Arts user can learn arts from this list.)*

#### Afterburst (Su)
**DP Cost:** 1 / 3 / 5  
**Modifies:** Weapon attack  
Any time you make a successful normal weapon attack, you may activate this art to have that attack deal an extra 1d4 fire damage. *(This damage is subject to critical multipliers where applicable.)*

**Overdrive** - The modified attack deals an additional 1d8+2 fire damage per overdrive level.

#### Explosive Retreat (Su)
**Requirements:**  Driver level 5  
**DP Cost:** 3  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Range:** 5 feet  
You ready your weapon at an adjacent target and fire a point-blank explosive blast,
dealing 2d4 force damage to the target, stunning it until the start of its next turn, and moving 25 feet in a straight line directly away from it. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity at any point except the end.

#### Lacerating Blur (Sp)
**Requirements:**  Driver level 9  
**DP Cost:** 5  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Range:** Weapon  
A rapid flurry of slashing blows with no regard for accuracy.

Make attack rolls against a target in range until one fails, adding a cumulative -2 penalty for each past the first. You deal 1dX bleed damage, where X is twice the number of successes. *(If X is more than 12, you instead deal as many d12s as go into X plus dY, Y being the remainder.)*

## Drive Arts - Burst Driver

#### Blastwave (Su)
**DP Cost:** 2  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Area:** 30-foot straight line  
You gather energy in your weapons, swinging them forward and sending a shockwave through the air before you, dealing 2d4 force damage to the first enemy you hit, each one thereafter taking half the damage (rounded up) that the previous one took.

#### Spin Burst (Su)
**Requirements:** Driver level 3, melee drive weapon  
**DP Cost:** 3  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Range:** Melee reach  
Roll damage as if making a single attack with your main-hand weapon if it is a *drive weapon*. You deal half that much fire damage (rounded up) to each target in a square that weapon could reach. Repeat for your offhand weapon.

#### Strike Dash (Su)
**Requirements:** Driver level 5  
**DP Cost:** 2
**Modifies:** Movement or charge  
Any time you run, charge, or make a normal move action, you may activate this art to move up to an additional 20 feet. If you then bull rush during the same turn, the target is pushed back an additional five feet.

#### Flashstrike (Su)
**Requirements:** Driver level 8, Burst Driver level 5  
**DP Cost:** 4  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Range:** 25 feet (line of sight)  
Your form crackles with lightning for a moment before you're barely more than a blur, blinking from target to target in a flurry of sizzling slashes.

Make an attack roll against a target in range; if successful, you deal 1d4+1 lightning damage to that target. For each successful attack you may repeat on another target within range of the last, with a cumulative -3 penalty to your attack roll for each roll past the first. *(You cannot strike the same target twice in a row.)*

At the end of this action you are placed in a square of your choosing directly adjacent to the target of your last successful attack. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

#### Disphasement (Su)
**Requirements:** Driver level 15  
**Modifies:** Damage taken  
An emergency technique that tears you halfway out of reality in a split second, leaving a shimmering shell of lingering energy around you.

You may activate this art in response to damage that would take you to zero or fewer hit points.
Your hit points are instead immediately set to 1d20 plus your driver level plus your constitution score upon activation, your AC is considered to be infinite and all damage to you is prevented until the end of your turn-after-next.

This art cannot be activated more than once per day.

## Drive Arts - Manadriver

#### Healing Shot (Sp)
**DP Cost:** 3  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Range:** Weapon  
You take aim at your target and fire off a small orb of healing magic that is absorbed on contact, restoring 1d6 hit points plus one additional point per driver level beyond the first.


#### Blast Shield (Sp)
**Requirements:** Driver level 8  
**DP Cost:** 5  
**Use Time:** 1 standard action  
**Range:** Weapon  
You fire a small polyhedral bolt of magic that shatters near your target, forming a spherical energy field around them which shields them from harm, granting 2d4+2 temporary hit points that last either until they next leave combat or until the end of the day, whichever comes sooner.

These temporary hit points do not stack with any other provided by a Drive Art; instead, take whichever value is higher.

**Cost:** 550 gp  
A long, broad, shallow crescent of a blade, sharp only on the convex edge, with a grip anchored roughly two-thirds down the length, pitched forward at around 65 degrees. Often harshly serrated.

A wingscythe counts as both a slashing and a piercing weapon for the purposes of determining eligibility for any class feature, feat or other effect.

Spell-like Drive Arts used with the range of this weapon do not provoke an attack of opportunity.
