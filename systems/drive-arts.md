# Drive Arts
Certain classes grant access to potent abilities drawing from an innate pool of latent magic, represented as Drive Points.
This reservoir has a limited capacity (as granted by classes and feats), but any points gained beyond this limit during combat last until the end of the user's current or upcoming turn.

- If multiple sources grant the same ability modifier to maximum Drive Points, only one applies.
- At the start of each day, a Drive Art user regains up to their maximum Drive Points.

Drive Arts can only be used while wielding a weapon with the *Drive weapon* property, as they are channeled through the weapon itself. Accordingly, arts of range type *weapon* have range of a single target within that weapon's melee range if it's a melee weapon, or line of sight within the first range increment if it's a ranged weapon. If the weapon is usable as both melee and ranged, then the wielder may choose between them as desired.

Manachargers do not use ammunition, but can only be fired by someone with some sort of magical aptitude (able to cast spells or use Drive Arts or other spell-like abilities).

Upon misfiring, a Manacharger does not gain the *broken* condition, but instead backfires, dealing 1d4 force damage to the wielder. (This does not increase the weapon's misfire rate.)
