# Drive Arts
Certain classes grant access to potent abilities drawing from an innate pool of latent magic, represented as Drive Points.
This reservoir has a limited capacity (as granted by classes and feats), but any points gained beyond this limit during combat last until the end of the user's current or upcoming turn.

- If multiple sources grant the same ability modifier to maximum Drive Points, only one applies.
- At the start of each day, a Drive Art user regains up to their maximum Drive Points.

Drive Arts can only be used while wielding a weapon with the *drive weapon* property, as they are channeled through the weapon itself. Accordingly, arts of range type *weapon* have range of a single target within that weapon's melee range if it's a melee weapon, or line of sight within the first range increment if it's a ranged weapon. If the weapon is usable as both melee and ranged, then the wielder may choose between them as desired.
