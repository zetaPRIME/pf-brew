### Class Features
#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Manadrivers are proficient with all simple weapons, ranged weapons with the *Drive weapon* property, and all light armor.

#### Drive Arts (Ex)
Beginning at 1st level, a manadriver gains access to potent abilities drawing from a pool of latent magic. She has a maximum pool of these Drive Points, as indicated in the [table below](#table-drive-arts), plus her Wisdom modifier. *(If a character has Drive Points from more than one source, only the highest modifier applies for bonus points.)* These points are expended to execute Drive Arts, of which she knows a number from the [Manadriver art list](#manadriver-drive-arts) in accordance with the aforementioned table.

Upon leveling up, in addition to learning new arts, a manadriver may exchange one art known for another.

At the start of each day, a manadriver regains up to her maximum Drive Points, and if she would gain Drive Points beyond her maximum, the extra points last until the end of her turn.

Drive Arts can only be used while wielding a weapon with the *Drive weapon* property, as they are channeled through the weapon itself. Accordingly, arts of range type *weapon* have range of a single target within that weapon's melee range if it's a melee weapon, line of sight within two range increments if it's a ranged weapon, or the weapon's stated range if it has one. If more than one of these is applicable, the wielder can choose between them as desired.

#### Siphon Shot (Su)

#### Focused Siphon Shot (Su)
Starting at 7th level, a manadriver can use a full-round action to [WIP]

#### Aetherocharger
*two-handed ranged weapon (advanced firearm)*  
**Damage:** 1d4 force  
**Critical:** 20/x1  
**Range:** 60ft  
**Properties:** Drive weapon  
**Weight:** 5lbs  
**Cost:** 750 gp  
Aetherochargers do not use ammunition, but can only be fired by someone with some sort of magical aptitude (able to cast spells or use Drive Arts or other spell-like abilities).

Upon misfiring, an Aetherocharger does not gain the *broken* condition, but instead backfires, dealing 1d4 force damage to the wielder. This does not increase the weapon's misfire rate.
