### Class Features
#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Burst Drivers are proficient with all simple weapons, all melee weapons with the *drive weapon* property, and all light armor.

#### Driver Arsenal (Ex)
A Burst Driver gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat with all weapons with the *drive weapon* property. She also gains the effect of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat while wielding two such weapons with the *dual drive* property.

This ability counts as having both the Weapon Finesse and Two-Weapon Fighting feats for the purposes of meeting feat requirements.

#### Drive Arts (Ex)
Beginning at 1st level, a Burst Driver gains access to potent abilities known as [Drive Arts](../systems/drive-arts.md). She gains access to the [Burst Driver art list](../systems/drive-arts.md#drive-arts---burst-driver), knows a number of arts as indicated by the table below, and is granted maximum Drive Points according to the same table plus her Wisdom modifier.

Upon leveling up, in addition to learning new arts, a Burst Driver may exchange any one art known for another.

#### Bonus Feats
At 1st level and at every third level thereafter, a Burst Driver gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement.
These bonus feats must be listed as Combat or Drive Feats.

Upon learning a bonus feat, a Burst Driver may additionally choose to replace a previously learned bonus feat with another, losing the old feat in exchange for the new.
The replaced feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another unless each such feat's prerequisites would still be met another way.

#### Siphon Strike (Su)
Starting at 1st level, a Burst Driver can use her weapons to siphon energy from her opponents.

When making an attack action, you gain one Drive Point for each successful hit with a *drive weapon*, plus one additional point for each critical threat scored.

#### TODO - AoO siphon
#### TODO - self-sustain for light armor
