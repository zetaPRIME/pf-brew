### Class Features
#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Burst Drivers are proficient with all simple weapons, melee weapons with the *Drive weapon* property, and all light armor.

#### Drive Arts (Ex)
Beginning at 1st level, a Burst Driver gains access to potent abilities known as [Drive Arts](../systems/drive-arts.md). She gains access to the [Burst Driver art list](../systems/drive-arts.md#drive-arts---burst-driver), knows a number of arts as indicated by the table below, and is granted maximum Drive Points according to the same table plus her Wisdom modifier.

Upon leveling up, in addition to learning new arts, a Burst Driver may exchange any one art known for another.

#### Siphon Strike (Su)
Starting at 1st level, a Burst Driver can use her weapons to siphon energy from her opponents.

When initiating an attack action, you may choose to activate this ability. If you do, make your attack rolls as normal, but do not roll for critical confirmation or damage; instead, you gain one Drive Point for each successful attack, plus one extra for each critical threat. You deal that many points of force damage to each target successfully struck.
